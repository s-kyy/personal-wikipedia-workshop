**Setting our goals**
Have a morning routine that starts at 9am and gets me at my desk around 9h45am. I will monitor this goal from Friday Nov 5th, 2020 (tomorrow) until Friday Jan 1st, 2021.
1. Wake up at 9am
2. Charge my phone
3. Brush my teeth and skin care regimen
4. Change Clothes
5. Head down to eat breakfast
6. Bring a cup of water/ tea to my room
7. Check off my morning routine habit on Notion (if it's before 9h45am). If not write down what did not work/ what obstacle did I have. 

Measurable: track it in Notion. (Checkmark for morning routine)
Character Strengths: Self-regulation (discipline)

First steps to take towards that goal:
- Setting up Notion
- Making the alarm clocks

Obstacles & Strengths to overcome them:
- Sleeping too late <-- Use my judgment to guilt myself into correcting my behavior.
- Having my phone with me at night will tempt me to stay in bed in the morning
- I'd want to keep being on my phone after eating: 

Use my support system (people I've communicated with for my 360 exercises with)

###### How to Maintain Long-lasting relationships #captures/webinar 
- Positive Relationship from school / work. What made it meaningful?
	- People I made a meaningful connection with are...
	- I pushed myself to the limit and did my best at the job. Didn't complain about anything, but asked them for advice when I felt stuck. 
	- Can be open and honest without the pressure of being error free.
	- Authentically wanting to be helpful, and you feel a sense of security in the work. 
1. **Communication Thoughtfully**
	- Show empathy by not jumping to conclusions and giving people the heads up to those that need it. Be conscious of people's time.  
	- Boundaries - keep in mind the differences between their culture vs the boss revealing too much of their personal life. Maintain privacy early on to get a lay of the land first. 
	- Don't highlight someone's error in an email. 
2. **Celebrate others**
	- If you're leading a project, then take the time to acknowledge people's hard work in the team.
	- If you participated or a colleague and they just finished organizing and executing a huge project, then take the time to congratulate them and point out specific things that made it so great. 
	- Support positive gossip (most difficult for me to do)
3. **Positions Everyone as Competent**
	- Highlight their strengths > Highlight their value to the team and thanking them for their observations & perspective > Apologize for the miscommunication. 
		- Two people were conflicted because one wanted to add their information together 

*ACTIVITY #2 :* Think about a recent scenario where I could have applied 1-2 of these first best practices. 
	- Talk with potential supervisors earlier in the year rather than later.
	- Give constructive criticism. 
	- Saying "Thank you for doing..."

4. **Create space for relationship building**
	- Be interested about your colleagues lives
	- Learn about their professional dreams, passions, and aspiration and help them live those dreams
	- Reach out to them regularly. Send them articles that remind you of them, send them invitations to events that might interest them. Just little check-ins. 
5. **Asking for feedback and collaborating often.**
	- create projects yourself and create opportunities for people in different teams to collaborate. 
	- Seek different perspectives from people in different teams. 
	- Make the effort to reach out often. 

*Activity #3:* How to apply the 5 best practices to a professional relationship(s) in your life? What small actions can I take right away?
- Communicate with my working relationships a bit earlier so it gives them time to respond. Mention some of their strengths and congratulate them on their hard work
	
**Extra Tips**

- Show gratitude for people that think of you, those that contribute anything into our lives
- Make eye contact
