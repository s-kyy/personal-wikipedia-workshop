# Workshop Outline

### To Do

- [ ]  Research Examples
- [ ]  Check Twitter for more examples of how people use Obsidian. 
- [ ]  Density, Size




### A) Ice breakers
- Get together in groups of 3
	- Q: Do you have a note-taking system? Describe what you use it for and what tools do you use to take notes?
- ==Pick out 2-3 people to see what they have to share==
- Share my own experience with note-taking
	- Everyone has a different way of falling into note-taking. I starts at a young age where you take notes for class, then compiling those notes into study material, jotting down dreams, tracking my favorite recipes, collecting interesting articles and videos I found on the internet. 
		- Class Notes: Physical -> Word -> One Note -> Notion -> Obsidian 
		- Dream journaling: Physical -> Obsidian
		- Recipe Books: Evernote <--> Obsidian
		- Life Planing: Google Calendar, Bullet Journaling
		- Collecting: Evernote -> Roam -> Obsidian
		- Research (Academic & Work): Notion -> Roam Research -> Obsidan 
	- However all of these are still consumption based, eventually the context of why I copied that article link or summarized those course notes will fade away over time. This makes it hard to remember why I thought they were important to write down in the first place. 
- When I stumbled upon Obsidian and saw how flexible it was, it introduced me to a more meaningful way to take notes.

### B) Intro about Obsidian
**Obsidian** software creates markdown files inside a designated folder called a vault. Subfolders can be made as well, and when searching within Obsidian, it can find files inside any folder in your vault.

see [[Examples of notes]]

Example when studying for an exam, you can quickly go through your exisiting notes and ideas, instead of lecture by lecture. When writing an essay you can start with a well developed topic and build on top of that instead of writing from scratch. 

### B) Getting setup
- Introduce the vault: The Obsidian software reads a folder, called the **vault**, on your computer and creates markdown files inside it. Subfolders can be made as well. When searching within Obsidian, it can find files inside any folder in your vault.

==Give time for participants to follow each step below==

- Light Mode
- Core Plugins Settings
	- Daily Notes (works well with Calendar plugin!)
- Images, Files, Templates folder
	- Create dedicated folder for pasted images. 
	- You can paste screenshots from your clipboard or [[Markdown Guide#^8b2361|embed an existing one]]. 
	- The image files don't necessarily need to be in that folder since it's just to tell the software where to put your pasted images. PDF files 
- Daily Notes folder
- **CTRL-O** (open a new/existing note) - fuzzy search
- **CTRL-P** (command pallette) - use this if you forget hotkeys or didn't set them
- **Navigation Bar** (your files & folders) & Sidebars - If you don’t like the current look of your workspace you can drag panes to the left or right, up or down.

### C) Article Walkthrough (Asynchronous Note-taking)
[[Markdown Guide]] - see Help vault for the manual

1. Start by reading, higlight on the article (done before the workshop)
2. Move the highlights and notes into Obsidian (see [[S- What if this isn't a good time for getting to know yourself - 1 Raw|here]])
	- Then add your own [[S- What if this isn't a good time for getting to know yourself - 2 Notes|commentary]]
	- Then add [[S- What if this isn't a good time for getting to know yourself - 3 Wiki-links|wikilinks]]
3. **Backlinks** - how it works
	1. Internal Linking/ Linked mentions - `[[ ]] ` (wikilink format)
		- e.g. [[Cats]] link to [[Animal]]
		- ==Have participants create 2-5 notes in their vault==
		- ==Try to make at least one wikilink to another note in your vault==
		- ==Moment to share what people have written==
	2. Unlinked References/ mentions - Obsidian not only shows explicit links, but if a note name is mentioned anywhere else in your notes, then it can be found in your vault. 
		- e.g. [[Dogs]] mention the word animal
		- ==Allow a moment for them to make unlinked references==
	3. Try to play with it in their own notes. 
4. Working with multiple notes open
5. **Aliases & YAML**: try typing `[[` 
	- e.g. "[[Do things in moderation|moderation]]" points to [[Do things in moderation]]

### D) Key Take-aways
- Write a note like you're going to read it again!
- A good time to make a dedicated note for something is when an idea comes up repeatedly or you search for it frequently. 
- You don't need to note down everything. Your atomic notes curate your thoughts and the things you learn. ^5b5db4
