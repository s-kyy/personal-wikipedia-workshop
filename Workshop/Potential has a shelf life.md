I associate **potential** with innate talent, and instinct. However, for someone's potential to mature they need to be trained. 

I can also associate it with *opportunity*. The "shelf life" of opportunity can be short to the point that you can be stressed trying to grab as many of them as you can. 

"Reaching your full potential"

Could also relate to the concept in physics.
