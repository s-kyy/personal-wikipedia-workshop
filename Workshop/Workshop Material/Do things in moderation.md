# Do things in moderation
 > Eat in moderation

This phrase is the first one that comes to mind from this idea, but of course it applies to both extremes of not eating too much nor eating too little. 

Another context moderation could apply to is pleasure and entertainment. Although it's good to relax and take a breather to refresh your mind, it's not so good spend all your time relaxing as you'll lose your momentum with study/ work, etc. 

Finding that balance is always a challenge. 
- **Exercise** has been a generic cycle of early New Years Resolutions followed by neglect as the semesters progress. Another way of tackling this is by making the sessions something I look forward to rather than something I'm forcing myself to do. As an experiment I've been trying out Ring Fit Adventures.
- My **Social Life** improved in some ways since COVID started. I think making the effort to schedule a weekly game night or a remote hangout has been a good way to get everyone connected despite not being able to see each other in-person. One aspect I'd like to improve on is to have a group work session where we could have unscheduled hangouts and simulate a library or cafe environment online. It would allow for those few friends that can never make it to the scheduled events. 
- **Self-improvement** is an aspect touched upon in [[S- What if this isn't a good time for getting to know yourself - 3 Wiki-links]]. As humans we work best in cycles of rest and stress, comfort and challenge. When trying to help myself I often-times fall into a hole of self-affirmation, which is not productive. Instead of ruminating and trying to theorize the solution, I should be performing [[trial and error]] (in moderation), so I can figure out practically what works and what doesn't.

%% Atomic Note-taking: dedicate a note to a single idea%%
%% The advantage of this is it makes it easier to link specific ideas to each other rather than an entire note on a book/ lecture/ article.%%
%% You can also then take advantage of Obsidian's graph view, you can see which ideas are connecting to other ideas. %%
