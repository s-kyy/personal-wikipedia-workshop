# What if this isn't a good time for getting to know yourself

### Context
Researching articles that might be good for the workshop.

### Notes

%% introduce unordered lists%%

> In the times when self-help is a commodified industry, aren’t we at risk of **reducing self-awareness** to a purely egocentric pursuit with the main purpose being to *prove our worth to ourselves*?


> However, when we become overly invested in the self-discovery quest, we might ==forget that other people even exist==.
- Connects well with FutureReady workshops like how to confront people or how to build better professional relationships.

%% Nested lists%%

> we all need a good mixture of challenge and comfort to advance as human beings.
- Atomic Note - Self-reflect on the highlight. Does it resonate with you? 
	- Expand on what sort of things challenge you and what sorts of things comfort you. How much do you do on both?


> The paradox of self-help is that the more self-help information you consume, the more you think you need help. When in fact, the last thing you need is help. You don’t need help. You need to love yourself. Enough so that you stop consuming self-help and start living


> shadow work is about — viewing those around us as mirrors that reflect what we can’t perceive inwardly. For example, what annoys you in your mom or your partner may be a reflection of that part of yourself that you never learned to accept, and maybe can't even see. If it wasn’t for those people reminding you, how could you possibly become aware of it?
- Self-awareness doesn't need to come from meditation, and isolation. In fact, quite the opposite.

%% Ordered Lists%%

What are some ideas you learned from the article?
1. Being self-aware also requires you to pay closer attention to how you feel about others. 
2. Do things in moderation, you can be comfortable but not be comfortable for too long. 

%% Checklists%%

What are some actionable things you could do this week?
- [ ] At least once a day this week, pay attention to my reactions and emotions about other people. Write it down
- [ ] Using those notes, journal about why that affected me and if I my values / behaviour are involved in my reaction.
