# How can I use templates?
1. Settings > Core Plugins > Templates > set to `on`
2. Plugin Options: Templates > Template folder location > add the location of your template folder. if you click on the text field a drop-down menu of all your folders should be present. 
3. Add new notes with the template structure you want. (EX: [[article notes template]]). 
4. Make a new note.
5. `CTRL-P` > Insert Template > Pick the template you want to add into your new note.

> Templates can be added at any time, not just when you create a new note, so if you want to add a shortcut for something you commonly write then templates can be used for that.
